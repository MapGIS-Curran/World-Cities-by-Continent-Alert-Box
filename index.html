    <h3>Trials And Tribulations</h3>
    <p>
I am very grateful that Lesson 6 is over now. It's been an uphill battle for sure. There was a fair bit of brain cell damage incurred (from the few cells that remain) during these past weeks trying to find relevant code samples of what needed to be accomplished with the prompt() method. I finally came across a few YouTube JS videos that were explained thoroughly and intelligently that gave me more than one a-ha! moment. There's definitely a lot of worthless crap out there I've wasted my time with when searching for coding lessons that make sense to me, but finding the gems, oh, how joyous it is to come across those and finally bridge another gap towards comprehension in a subject matter that doesn't come easy to me. Brute force. That's my mantra to learning to code.

    <p>  
There was a lot of Brute Force applied in this lesson, and I must add it's somewhat mind-blowing how fast the hours go by when you are desperately trying to code something new into existence. Given how fast it's gone by during the long hours staring at code the past few weeks, time must really be irrelevant in this life. Alright, enough of venting.

There were many firsts during the completion of this assignment, one being simply changing the theme of the CSS reference to give it the current dark green theme I stumbled across recently, along with adding this div element below the dynamic map.
    </p>
    <p>
I also came across another cool Esri example using a thematic multivariate visualization which triggered me into tweaking the code snippets so that I could display the queried cities in shades of green combined with point size based on the population field values. This took a while to tweak just right, but it seemed rather intuitive after reading just a few paragraphs on what needed to be done. The only issue I had was that for some reason I can't get the circles in the legend to be outlined in green like the example I was admiring had them.
    </p>
    <p>
Of course there also was the lesson readings that I came away with new insights on topics such as promises (thankfully an easy concept), querying and selecting features, and the search widget. I do dig the fact that the course has condensed topics to focus on as the JS API reference is just so freaking overwhelming.
    </p>
    <p>
As I started to get closer to completion on this lesson, I really started realizing how many different ways this could have been coded, just from my small amount of understanding of what is going on. There must have been quite a few different iterations submitted from the other students for this assignment, some using definition expressions, while some used graphic objects and query features methods. From a learning standpoint, it'd be cool to see all of the anonymous submissions of the code for this assignment for the different scenarios (as long as it was code that actually works). Regardless, I'm definitely looking forward to the GUI exercises for next week's assignment, and especially the final project as I have an idea in mind that I've been chewing on for some time now.

      One question:
      <br>Q: How do I get the circles on the legend to display the "#71de6e" color as their outline?<br />
